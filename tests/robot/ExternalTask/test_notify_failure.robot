Test 'Notify failure' for existing topic
    Given A new process instance
    ${process_instance}    And process instance fetched

    When notify failure   retry_timeout=${None}

    Then No Process Instance available at topic    topic=${existing_topic}    error_message=Notifying Failure failed. Process instance should not be available anymore at service task.
    And Process instance is incident    ${process_instance}

Test 'Notify failure' with setting retry_timeout
    # GIVEN
    Given A new process instance
    ${process_instance}    And process instance fetched

    When notify failure    retry_timeout=100

    Then No Process Instance available at topic    topic=${existing_topic}    error_message=Notifying Failure failed. Process instance should not be available anymore at service task.
    And Process instance is incident    ${process_instance}

Test 'Notify failure' with unfinished retries
    Given A new process instance
    ${process_instance}    And Fetch Workload and notify failure    retries=1    retry_timeout=0

    Then Process Instance available at topic    topic=${existing_topic}    error_message=Notifying Failure failed. Process instance should not be available anymore at service task.
    And Process instance is not incident    ${process_instance}

Test 'Notify failure' with retries countdown
    Given A new process instance
    ${process_instance}    And Fetch Workload and notify failure    retries=1    retry_timeout=0

    ${process_instance_retry}    When Fetch Workload and notify failure    retries=1    retry_timeout=0

    Then No Process Instance available at topic    topic=${existing_topic}    error_message=Notifying Failure failed. Process instance should not be available anymore at service task.
