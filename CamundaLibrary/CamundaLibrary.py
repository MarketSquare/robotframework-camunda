class CamundaLibrary:
    """
    Library for Camunda integration in Robot Framework

    = Installation =

    == Camunda ==

    Easiest to run Camunda in docker:
    | docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run-latest

    == CamundaLibrary ==
    You can use pip for installing CamundaLibrary:
    | pip install robotframework-camunda

    = Usage =

    The library provides convenience keywords for accessing Camunda via REST API. You may deploy models,
    start processes, fetch workloads and complete them.

    When initializing the library the default url for Camunda is `http://localhost:8080` which is the default when
    running Camunda locally. It is best practice to provide a variable for the url, so it can be set dynamically
    by the executing environment (like on local machine, in pipeline, on test system and production):

    | Library | CamundaLibrary | ${CAMUNDA_URL} |

    Running locally:
    | robot -v "CAMUNDA_URL:http://localhost:8080" task.robot

    Running in production
    | robot -v "CAMUNDA_URL:https://camunda-prod.mycompany.io" task.robot

    = Execution =

    In contrast to external workers that are common for Camunda, tasks implemented with CamundaLibrary do not
    _subscribe_ on certain topics. A robot tasks is supposed to run once. How frequent the task is executed is up
    to the operating environment of the developer.

    == Subscribing a topic / long polling ==
    You may achieve a kind of subscription by providing the ``asyncResponseTimeout`` with the `Fetch workload`
    keyword in order to achieve [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/#long-polling-to-fetch-and-lock-external-tasks|Long Polling].

    | ${variables} | fetch workload | my_topic | async_response_timeout=60000 |
    | log | Waited at most 1 minute before this log statement got executed |

    = Missing Keywords =

    If you miss a keyword, you can utilize the REST API from Camunda by yourself using the [https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-requests|RequestsLibrary].
    With RequestsLibrary you can access all of the fully documented [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/|Camunda REST API].

    = Feedback =

    Feedback is very much appreciated regardless if it is comments, reported issues, feature requests or even merge
    requests. You are welcome to participating in any way at the [https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-camunda|GitHub project of CamundaLibrary].
